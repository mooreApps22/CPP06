		static methods	
			uintptr_t	serialize(Data* ptr);

			Data*		deserialize(uintptr_t raw);
				-> It takes an unsigned integer type uintptr_t & converts it to a pointer to Data

	Data Class
		this class has to have non-empty data members

	serialize() on the Data object address and pass the return into deserialize()

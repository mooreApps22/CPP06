	Identify Real Type

	No class in this exercise has to Orthodox Canonical Form

	Make a Base class
		it has a public virtual destructor (so that makes it an Abstract Base Class, right)

	Make three empty classes A, B, C (what is an empty class?) 
		they inherit from Base 

	Program Functions:
	
		Base*	generate(void);
			this program function will randomly generate one of the three classes, A, B, C

		void	identify(Base* p);
			this will print the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A" "B" "C"

		void	identify(Base& p);
			It prints the actual type of the object referenced by p: "A" "B" "C"
				this function is not allowed to use a pointer 

		typeinfo header is forbidden
